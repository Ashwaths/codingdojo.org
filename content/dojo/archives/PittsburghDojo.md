    The Pittsburgh Coding Dojo has been meeting since April 2006.

Our home page is at pghcodingdojo.org, and we have a mailing list at
groups.yahoo.com/groups/pghcodingdojo.org

We have evening meetings every month (usually the first Tuesday of the
month, though that varies) at the Pittsburgh Technology Council
(pghtech.org).

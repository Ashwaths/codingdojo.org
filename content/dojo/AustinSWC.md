The Austin Software Craftsmanship Meetup holds a Coding Dojo once a quarter (next dojo Jan 2019). 
We use [Cyber-Dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org) as a platform in order to support multiple languages and test frameworks. 
Join us on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/austin-software-craftsmanship/) for more info.

Our dojo is run "Glasgow style", with pairs working together 
on their own laptops, all on the same kata but not necessarily
all on the same language. Open to all experience levels; 
if you're interested in improving your craft, we want you!
